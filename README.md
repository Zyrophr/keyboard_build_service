**TL:DR** I offer free custom mechanical keyboards build service and I stream them on Twitch ([VOD of a customer build](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/853917547))! I offer solder, stabs mod/lube, but not switch modding! If you're interested, please fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/odka4qqg7pUrKRXf9)

 

## **Hi !**

**Happy new Year!** 

I hope you guys and girls are doing well on this first day of 2021 and that you spent wonderful holydays! 

This is my first time posting about my service so I would like to introduce myself first. My name is William, and I'm known on the internet as Zyrophr. I'm a French guy, currently studying in a Computer Science school.

I started to be passionate about custom mechanical keyboards a little more than 2 years ago now, and started streaming in October 2020, and I'm having a wonderful time. I've been streaming keyboards builds recently though, and not that many (student life, you know).



## Free building service uh?

*Yes*. And I promise you there is absolutely no catch. I love building keyboards, and I love streaming. So why not do both at the same time? I know this is a really niche hobby, and a big part of it is the DIY part, but I'm sure that some people out there don't have the money to buy tools or to pay a build service, nor the time. So, if I can help, I'm more than happy to do so.

My build service will be *completely free* as long as you pay for the shipping, **both ways**. My service includes building and stabs lubing/modding, but nothing else (to an extent). That means I won't mod your switches (no lubing nor filming). The reason is that I unfortunately do not have time for that, and not that much of lube.



## Where?

I'm located in Paris, France. That means that I will only serve EU folks for now. I do not plan to offer an outside EU service at the moment, because of the expensive shipping prices (unless you're willing to pay a lot, that's on you).

Also, as I'm French, *most of my streams will be French-speaking focused*. **That said**, I also speak English, and I plan to alternate as needed during the stream. I've had international viewers before and the exchanges have always gone well. Of course, if you come on the stream I will speak to you in English!

## Previous builds

I started streaming recently, so most of those build aren't recorded at all, but I do post pictures and stuff on Twitter/Reddit or Discord! From now on, every new build I do will be streamed live on Twitch (and one day be archived on YouTube) though, so the client have a way to make sure everything goes fine and can interact with me in real time!
